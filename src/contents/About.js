            <br></br>
            <p>For the love of design and the love of learning, software development will always be a passion.
            
            To me, this career is about more than building websites. Rather, I see this career as one that provides a medium between business
            and the humanities.

            As technology continues to make unknown things possible, my hope is that I can play a small role in making that technology both easy to use and beautiful.
